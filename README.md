# Implementation of a 16-Point 16-Bit Signed Integer Fast Fourier Transform
This code repository provides the code used in the paper "Implementation of a 16-Point 16-Bit Signed Integer Fast Fourier Transform" published & presented as part of the IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference on March 15th, 2025. 

This code contains a Python `fft.ipynb` that contains a 16-Point 16-Bit Fast Fourier Transform implementation that is structured similarly to that of the SystemVerilog code. 

On the FPGA side, the folder was written and tested with Intel Quartus and ModelSim Altera. Please use ModelSim Altera to run the code via the command line built into ModelSim Altera for best results.
